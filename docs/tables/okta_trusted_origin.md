# Table: okta_trusted_origin

A Trusted Origin is a security-based concept that combines the URI scheme, hostname, and port number of a page. All cross-origin web requests and redirects from Okta to your organizationâ€™s websites must be explicitly allowed.

When external URLs are requested during sign-in, sign-out, or recovery operations, Okta checks those URLs against the allowed list of Trusted Origins. Trusted Origins also enable browser-based applications to access Okta APIs from JavaScript (CORS). If the origins aren't specified, the related operation (redirect or Okta API access) isn't permitted.

Note: This table does not support the optional `filter` column to query results based on Okta supported [filters](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/trusted-origins/#list-trusted-origins-with-a-filter).

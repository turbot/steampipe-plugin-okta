# Table: okta_password_policy

The [Password Policy](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/policy/#password-policy) determines the requirements for a user's password length and complexity, as well as the frequency with which a password must be changed. This Policy also governs the recovery operations that may be performed by the User, including change password, reset (forgot) password, and self-service password unlock.

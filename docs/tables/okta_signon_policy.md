# Table: okta_signon_policy

The [Sign On Policy](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/policy/#okta-sign-on-policy) controls the manner in which a user is allowed to sign on to Okta, including whether they are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA) and how long they are allowed to remain signed in before re-authenticating.
